### Goal
Hey! Personally I use Google Keep all the time and I love the way it looks! I also love how fast and easy to use it is! This is my attempt in recreating something like it to better increase my understanding of React and Redux! It would be awesome if you would like to check it out and let me know what you think!
If you aren't familiar with Google Keep you can check it out [here!](https://keep.google.com/)

1. Then run ``` npm install ``` to install all dependencies.
2. Then run ``` npm start ``` to get the react server started up and navigate to "http://localhost:3000/"
